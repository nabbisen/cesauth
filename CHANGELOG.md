# Changelog

All notable changes to cesauth will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

cesauth is pre-1.0. The public surface — endpoints, `wrangler.toml`
variable names, secret names, D1 schema, and `core::ports` traits —
may change between minor versions until 1.0. Breaking changes will
always be called out here.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- **HTML two-step confirmation UI for bucket-safety edits.** The
  pre-0.3.1 preview/apply JSON API is unchanged; 0.3.1 adds a
  form-based wrapper that the Configuration Review page now links to
  per bucket (Operations+ only). The flow:
  1. `GET /admin/console/config/:bucket/edit` renders an edit form
     pre-populated with the current attested state.
  2. `POST` submits the proposed values; the handler re-renders the
     same URL as a confirmation page showing a before/after diff with
     the changed fields highlighted.
  3. Submitting the "Apply" button on the confirmation page re-POSTs
     with `confirm=yes` and the handler commits the change, auditing
     both the attempt (`attempt:BUCKET`) and the outcome
     (`ok:BUCKET`), then 303-redirects back to the review page.
  Corresponds to spec §7's "二段階確認" for dangerous operations.

- **Admin-token CRUD UI (Super-only).** New screens at
  `/admin/console/tokens`:
  - `GET  /admin/console/tokens` — table of non-disabled rows in
    `admin_tokens` (id, role, name, disable button).
  - `GET  /admin/console/tokens/new` — form to mint a new token.
  - `POST /admin/console/tokens` — server mints 256 bits of
    getrandom-sourced plaintext (two `Uuid::new_v4()` concatenated),
    SHA-256-hashes it for storage, inserts the row, and renders the
    plaintext **exactly once** with a prominent one-shot warning.
    Emits `AdminTokenCreated`.
  - `POST /admin/console/tokens/:id/disable` — flips `disabled_at`;
    refuses to disable the caller's own token to prevent accidental
    self-lockout. Emits `AdminTokenDisabled`.
  Per spec §14 ("provisional simple implementation" until tenant
  boundaries land), the list shows only `id`/`role`/`name`; richer
  `created_at` / `last_used_at` / `disabled_at` metadata is a
  post-tenant decision.

- **Conditional Tokens tab in the admin nav.** Visible only when the
  current principal's role is `Super`. Other roles still get a 403
  from the route if they navigate there directly — the tab
  visibility is a UX convenience, not a security boundary.

- **New audit event kinds**: `AdminTokenCreated`, `AdminTokenDisabled`.

- **Test coverage** (+10 tests, total 103):
  - `adapter-test`: token-CRUD roundtrip, hash uniqueness →
    `PortError::Conflict`, disable-unknown → `PortError::NotFound`.
  - `ui`: role-badge rendering, Tokens-tab visibility matrix,
    HTML-escape on untrusted notes, HTML-escape on displayed
    plaintext bearer, changed-fields marker correctness,
    no-change short-circuit on the confirm page, empty-list
    bootstrap-fallback hint.

### Changed

- **Fix: admin pages now show the caller's actual role in the header
  badge.** `cost_page`, `audit_page`, and `alerts_page` were
  hardcoding `Role::ReadOnly` and omitting the operator name; they
  now take an `&AdminPrincipal` like the other pages and propagate
  the role and label through to the header.

- **`AdminPrincipal` gained `Serialize`.** Needed so
  `GET /admin/console/tokens?Accept=application/json` can return the
  list as-is. `Deserialize` is deliberately *not* derived —
  adapters build these from their own row shapes, and nothing on the
  wire should revive one from a client blob.

- **Configuration Review's "Editing" section rewritten.** Pre-0.3.1
  it pointed operators at the JSON API only; it now describes the
  in-UI edit flow first and keeps the JSON recipes as a scripted
  alternative.

### Security

- **Token plaintext is touched for exactly one request path.** The
  server holds the plaintext only long enough to (a) SHA-256 it for
  storage and (b) render it once on the created-token page; no logs,
  no DO state, no error paths mention it. If the operator closes
  that tab without copying, they disable the token and create a new
  one.

- **Self-disable guard on `/admin/console/tokens/:id/disable`.** The
  handler refuses to disable the same principal id that
  authenticated the request. Not a security issue (the operator is
  already authorized to do it), but an accidental lockout of the
  only active Super is painful enough to catch here. The
  `ADMIN_API_KEY` bootstrap path is unaffected: `super-bootstrap`
  has no row and cannot be disabled from the UI at all.

### Deferred (tracked for 0.3.2+)

- **Workers-request and Turnstile-verify hot-path counters.** The
  admin console already reads these KV keys; writing them has a
  residual design question (at what request granularity do we
  count — every fetch, only successful handlers, by path?) that is
  not settled by the spec. See `ROADMAP.md`.
- **Durable Objects enumeration.** Still blocked on a Cloudflare
  runtime API that does not exist.


---

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- **Cost & Data Safety Admin Console.** A new operator-facing surface
  under `/admin/console/*`, separate from the user-authentication body.
  Six server-rendered HTML pages plus a small JSON-write surface:

  | Path                                    | Min role    | Purpose                                        |
  |-----------------------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------|
  | `GET  /admin/console`                   | ReadOnly    | Overview: alert counts, recent events, last verifications |
  | `GET  /admin/console/cost`              | ReadOnly    | Cost dashboard — per-service metrics & trend  |
  | `GET  /admin/console/safety`            | ReadOnly    | Data-safety dashboard — per-bucket attestation |
  | `POST /admin/console/safety/:b/verify`  | Security+   | Stamp a bucket-safety attestation as re-verified |
  | `GET  /admin/console/audit`             | ReadOnly    | Audit-log search (prefix / kind / subject filters) |
  | `GET  /admin/console/config`            | ReadOnly    | Configuration review (attested settings + thresholds) |
  | `POST /admin/console/config/:b/preview` | Operations+ | Preview a bucket-safety change (diff, no commit) |
  | `POST /admin/console/config/:b/apply`   | Operations+ | Commit a bucket-safety change (requires `confirm:true`) |
  | `GET  /admin/console/alerts`            | ReadOnly    | Alert center — rolled-up cost + safety alerts   |
  | `POST /admin/console/thresholds/:name`  | Operations+ | Update an operator-editable threshold            |

  Every GET is `Accept`-aware: browsers get HTML, `Accept: application/json`
  gets the same payload as JSON — so curl and the browser share one
  URL surface.

- **Four-role admin authorization model.** `ReadOnly` / `Security` /
  `Operations` / `Super`, enforced by a single pure function
  `core::admin::policy::role_allows(role, action)`. Each handler
  declares its `AdminAction` and the policy layer decides. Role
  matrix:

  | Action                  | RO | Sec | Ops | Super |
  |-------------------------|----|-----|-----|-------|
  | `ViewConsole`           | ✓  | ✓   | ✓   | ✓     |
  | `VerifyBucketSafety`    |    | ✓   | ✓   | ✓     |
  | `RevokeSession`         |    | ✓   | ✓   | ✓     |
  | `EditBucketSafety`      |    |     | ✓   | ✓     |
  | `EditThreshold`         |    |     | ✓   | ✓     |
  | `CreateUser`            |    |     | ✓   | ✓     |
  | `ManageAdminTokens`     |    |     |     | ✓     |

  The pre-existing `ADMIN_API_KEY` secret becomes the Super bootstrap:
  a fresh deployment with only that secret set still has console
  access at the Super tier. Additional principals live in the new
  `admin_tokens` D1 table (SHA-256-hashed, never plaintext). See
  [Admin Console — Expert chapter](docs/src/expert/admin-console.md).

- **Honest edge-native metrics.** The dashboard is deliberately
  truthful about what a Worker can and cannot see at runtime. D1 row
  counts come from `COUNT(*)` on tracked tables. R2 object counts and
  bytes come from `bucket.list()` summation. Workers and Turnstile
  counts come from a self-maintained `counter:<service>:<YYYY-MM-DD>`
  pattern in KV. Durable-Object metrics are deliberately empty — the
  Workers runtime cannot enumerate DO instances, so the dashboard
  surfaces a note pointing operators at the Cloudflare dashboard
  rather than fabricating numbers.

- **Bucket safety = operator attestation.** Workers runtime cannot
  read Cloudflare's R2 control-plane (is-public / CORS / lifecycle /
  bucket-lock state). We therefore record what the operator last
  confirmed the bucket to be, with a `last_verified_at` stamp and a
  configurable staleness threshold. Stale attestations raise a `warn`
  alert; any bucket attested public raises a `critical` alert
  regardless of which bucket it is.

- **Audit-log search over R2.** New `CloudflareAuditQuerySource`
  walks the date-partitioned `audit/YYYY/MM/DD/<uuid>.ndjson` tree,
  parses each object, and applies `kind_contains` / `subject_contains`
  filters in the adapter. Hard-capped at 200 objects per call so one
  console view can never fan out to thousands of R2 GETs.

- **Five new `EventKind` variants.**
  `AdminLoginFailed`, `AdminConsoleViewed`, `AdminBucketSafetyVerified`,
  `AdminBucketSafetyChanged`, `AdminThresholdUpdated`. Every console
  view is audited — §11 of the extension spec asks that monitoring
  failures themselves be audit-visible, and logging views captures
  the intent side of that.

- **Migration `0002_admin_console.sql`.** Four tables:
  `admin_tokens`, `bucket_safety_state`, `cost_snapshots`,
  `admin_thresholds`. Five default thresholds seeded; rows for the
  two shipped R2 buckets (`AUDIT`, `ASSETS`) seeded with conservative
  defaults. `INSERT OR IGNORE` throughout so the migration is
  re-runnable.

- **Expert chapter `docs/src/expert/admin-console.md`.** Covers the
  role model, the permission matrix, the change-operation protocol
  (preview → apply), the metrics-source fidelity matrix, and the
  bootstrap / token-provisioning curl recipes.

### Changed

- **`routes::admin` refactored into a submodule tree.** What used to
  be one 145-line file is now:
  - `routes/admin.rs` — parent, re-exports legacy `create_user` /
    `revoke_session` so `lib.rs`'s wiring didn't have to change.
  - `routes/admin/auth.rs` — bearer → principal resolution +
    `ensure_role_allows` helper.
  - `routes/admin/legacy.rs` — existing user-management endpoints,
    now role-gated (`CreateUser` requires Operations+,
    `RevokeSession` requires Security+; previously both required the
    single `ADMIN_API_KEY`).
  - `routes/admin/console.rs` + `routes/admin/console/*` — the v0.3.0
    console.

- **UI crate now depends on `cesauth-core`.** The admin templates
  read domain types directly from `core::admin::types` rather than
  redeclaring them, which would have drifted. `core` has no
  Cloudflare deps (enforced by its module-level comment), so this
  does not pull worker/wasm code into the UI build.

- **ROADMAP: "Audit retention policy tooling" moved from Planned to
  Shipped** as part of the admin console (the console's
  Configuration Review page surfaces each bucket's lifecycle
  attestation; the Alert Center flags staleness).

### Deferred (for 0.3.1)

None of these block §13 of the extension spec — the initial
completion criteria are met. They are recorded here so the scope
of 0.3.0 is unambiguous:

- **HTML edit forms with two-step confirmation UI.** 0.3.0 ships the
  preview → apply pair as a JSON API. The HTML confirm-screen flow
  (preview page → nonce-gated apply) is priority 8 in the spec; the
  scripted pair satisfies §7 (danger-operation preview + audit) in
  the meantime.
- **Admin-token CRUD UI.** 0.3.0 requires operators to INSERT rows
  into `admin_tokens` via a `wrangler d1 execute` command
  (documented in the expert chapter). A Super-only `/admin/tokens`
  HTML surface lands in 0.3.1.
- **Workers-request counter hot-path instrumentation.** 0.3.0 reads
  the `counter:workers:requests:*` KV keys and will report whatever
  is there; the actual `.increment()` call on every request is the
  0.3.1 work. Fresh deployments see zeros.
- **DO-instance enumeration.** Blocked on the Cloudflare Workers
  runtime API, which does not expose DO listing. Shipped as
  "unavailable — see CF dashboard" with a note; wired once CF
  ships the capability.

### Test counts

- `core`            — 72 passed (56 pre-admin + 16 admin policy / service)
- `adapter-test`    — 17 passed (6  pre-admin + 11 admin in-memory adapters)
- `ui`              — 4 passed (unchanged; admin templates exercised by
  `cargo check` rather than unit tests — their contract is HTML shape,
  which breaks visibly)
- **Total**: 93 host lib tests pass; `cargo-1.91 check --workspace` clean.

---

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-24

### Changed

- **Refactor: test modules extracted to sibling `tests.rs` files.**
  Every `#[cfg(test)] mod tests { ... }` block in `src/` has been
  moved to a sibling `<basename>/tests.rs` file (e.g.
  `crates/core/src/service/token.rs` + `crates/core/src/service/token/tests.rs`).
  The parent file now contains only `#[cfg(test)] mod tests;`.
  Eighteen files changed, all sixty-six host-lib tests still pass
  unchanged. Rationale: parent-file size is dominated by production
  code instead of fixtures, diffs stay focused, and the extracted
  test files are easier to point at in code review.

- **Refactor: large trait-adapter files split by port/handler.** Seven
  files that mixed multiple independent `impl Trait for Struct` blocks
  or multiple HTTP handlers have been split into submodules:

  | Was                                                  | Became (submodules)                                                   |
  |------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | `adapter-cloudflare/src/ports/repo.rs` (688 lines)   | `users` / `clients` / `authenticators` / `grants` / `signing_keys`     |
  | `adapter-cloudflare/src/ports/store.rs` (410 lines)  | `auth_challenge` / `refresh_token_family` / `active_session` / `rate_limit` |
  | `adapter-test/src/repo.rs`                           | same five names as the cloudflare adapter                              |
  | `adapter-test/src/store.rs`                          | same four names as the cloudflare adapter                              |
  | `worker/src/routes/oidc.rs` (494 lines)              | `discovery` / `jwks` / `authorize` / `token` / `revoke`                |
  | `worker/src/routes/magic_link.rs` (413 lines)        | `request` / `verify` (Turnstile helpers stay in the parent)            |
  | `worker/src/routes/webauthn.rs` (287 lines)          | `register` / `authenticate` (grouped by ceremony; `rp_from_config` stays in the parent) |

  The D1 helpers (`d1_int`, `run_err`, `db`) stay in the parent
  `repo.rs`; the DO-RPC helpers (`rpc_request`, `rpc_call`) stay in
  the parent `store.rs`; `crates/worker/src/routes/magic_link.rs`
  keeps the shared Turnstile-flag helpers (`turnstile_flag_key`,
  `turnstile_required`, `flag_turnstile_required`, `enforce_turnstile`)
  that both `request` and `verify` consume. Submodules access these
  via `super::` to avoid duplication.

- **Deliberately not split** (boundaries tight enough after test
  extraction, or intertwined enough that splitting would fragment a
  single concept): `core/src/webauthn/cose.rs` (395 lines post-tests;
  COSE key parsing, attestation-object parsing, and `AuthData`
  accessors are mutually referenced), `core/src/webauthn/registration.rs`
  (270 lines post-tests; one ceremony), `core/src/webauthn/authentication.rs`
  (228 lines post-tests; one ceremony), `core/src/service/token.rs`
  (285 lines post-tests; a composed service layer), `core/src/oidc/authorization.rs`
  (183 lines post-tests), `core/src/session.rs`, `core/src/ports/store.rs`,
  `ui/src/templates.rs`, `worker/src/log.rs`, `worker/src/post_auth.rs`.

- **Workspace version bumped to `0.2.1`.** All five crates inherit
  from `workspace.package.version` so the single change propagates.

### Build state

- `cargo check --workspace` clean.
- Host lib tests: 56 (core) + 6 (adapter-test) + 4 (ui) + 16 (worker)
  = 82 passed, 0 failed. Same counts as before the refactor.
- No public-API changes. All `pub` items that existed under the old
  module paths remain available at their original path because the
  parent files re-export them (`pub use submodule::Name;`). External
  users of `cesauth_cf::ports::repo::CloudflareUserRepository`,
  `cesauth_core::routes::oidc::token`, etc., require no source
  changes.

---

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Documentation restructure.** The previous monolithic
  `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/local-development.md` have been
  migrated into an [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) site
  under `docs/`, split into a beginner-facing *Getting Started* track
  and an expert-facing *Concepts & Reference* track plus a
  *Deployment* section and an *Appendix* (endpoints, error codes,
  glossary).
- **Project governance files at the repository root.** `ROADMAP.md`,
  `CHANGELOG.md`, `.github/SECURITY.md`, `TERMS_OF_USE.md`.
- **`/token` observability.** Every 500 path in the token handler now
  emits a structured `log::emit` line with the appropriate category
  (`Config`, `Crypto`, or `Auth`), so `wrangler tail` shows the
  immediate cause of a token-endpoint failure instead of a bare 500.
- **Dev-only helper routes** (`GET /__dev/audit`,
  `POST /__dev/stage-auth-code/:handle`), gated on
  `WRANGLER_LOCAL="1"`. They exist to make the end-to-end curl
  tutorial runnable without a browser cookie jar. Production deploys
  MUST NOT set `WRANGLER_LOCAL`.

### Changed

- **README is now slim.** Storage responsibilities, crate layout, and
  implementation status have moved out of the README into the book
  (storage / crate layout) and `ROADMAP.md` (implementation status).
  The README keeps a Quick Start and an Endpoints table and points
  into the book for detail.
- **`jsonwebtoken` now built with the `rust_crypto` feature.**
  Version 10.x requires a crypto provider; we pick the pure-Rust one
  (ed25519-dalek / p256 / rsa / sha2 / hmac / rand) and explicitly
  NOT `aws_lc_rs`, which vendors a C library and does not build for
  `wasm32-unknown-unknown`. With `default-features = false` and
  neither feature set, jsonwebtoken 10 panics at first use.
- **`config::load_signing_key` normalizes escape sequences.** The
  function accepts either real newlines or literal `\n` escapes in
  the PEM body; the latter is useful for single-line dotenv setups.

### Fixed

- **D1 `bind()` now uses a `d1_int(i64) -> JsValue` helper.**
  `wasm_bindgen` converts a Rust `i64` into a JavaScript `BigInt` on
  the wire, but D1's `bind()` rejects BigInt with
  `cannot be bound`. The helper coerces via `JsValue::from_f64` the
  same way worker-rs's `D1Type::Integer` does internally. Every
  INSERT / UPDATE site now uses it.
- **`run_err(context, worker::Error) -> PortError::Unavailable`
  helper** logs the underlying D1 error via `console_error!` before
  collapsing it into the payload-less `PortError::Unavailable`
  variant. Previously, the HTTP layer just said "storage error" with
  no breadcrumb.
- **`.tables` in the beginner tutorial** (`sqlite3` dot-command) has
  been replaced with a real `SELECT … FROM sqlite_master` query.
  `wrangler d1 execute` runs its `--command` argument through D1's
  SQL path, which does not interpret dot-commands.

### Security

- **Session cookies now use HMAC-SHA256, not JWT.** The session
  cookie is an internal server-to-browser token with no need for
  algorithm negotiation or third-party verification, and the
  simpler `<b64url(payload)>.<b64url(hmac)>` format sidesteps a
  class of JWT-library pitfalls.
- **`__Host-cesauth_pending` is unsigned by design; `__Host-cesauth_session` is signed.**
  The pending cookie carries only a server-side handle; forging it
  points to a non-existent or mis-bound challenge and is rejected
  on `take`. The session cookie carries identity and MUST be signed.
- **Sensitive log categories default to off.** `Auth`, `Session`, and
  `Crypto` lines are dropped unless `LOG_EMIT_SENSITIVE=1` is set.
  Enabling this in production should be an explicit, time-boxed ops
  action.

## Release-gate reminders

Before cesauth's first production deploy:

1. Replace the `dev-delivery` audit line in
   `routes::magic_link::request` with a real transactional-mail
   HTTP call keyed by `MAGIC_LINK_MAIL_API_KEY`.
2. `WRANGLER_LOCAL` MUST be `"0"` (or unset) in the deployed
   environment. Verify with an explicit `[env.production.vars]`
   entry rather than relying on inheritance.
3. Freshly generate `JWT_SIGNING_KEY`, `SESSION_COOKIE_KEY`, and
   `ADMIN_API_KEY` per environment; do not reuse local-dev values.

See
[Deployment → Migrating from local to production](docs/src/deployment/production.md)
for the full release-gate walkthrough.
