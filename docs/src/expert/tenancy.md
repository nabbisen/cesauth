# Tenancy

Starting with v0.4.0 cesauth ships the data model and authorization
engine for multi-tenant SaaS deployments. The single-tenant
deployment that v0.3.x supports continues to work unchanged; the new
machinery is additive.

This chapter is the operator-facing reference for how the new model
fits together. The matching domain spec is
`Tenancy service + authz 拡張開発指示書` in the
repository root; this chapter implements §3-§5 and §16.1, §16.3,
§16.6.

> **Status of v0.4.x.**
> v0.4.0 shipped the data model
> (`crates/core/src/{tenancy,authz,billing}/`), the in-memory
> adapters for host tests, the central `check_permission` function,
> and the D1 schema in migration `0003_tenancy.sql`.
>
> v0.4.1 added the **Cloudflare D1 adapters** for every port and
> made the existing `users` table tenant-aware via migration
> `0004_user_tenancy_backfill.sql`. Every existing user is now
> associated to the bootstrap tenant; email uniqueness becomes
> per-tenant.
>
> v0.4.2 shipped the **`/api/v1/...` HTTP API** for tenant /
> organization / group / membership / role-assignment / subscription
> CRUD, with plan-quota enforcement on the create paths. The API is
> gated through the existing 0.3.x admin-bearer mechanism with two
> new capabilities (`ViewTenancy` / `ManageTenancy`).
>
> v0.4.3 ships a **read-only HTML SaaS console** at `/admin/saas/*`
> for cesauth's operator staff to inspect tenancy state without
> curling the JSON API. Five pages — overview, tenants list, tenant
> detail, organization detail, subscription history, user role
> assignments — all read-only by design. Mutation forms (the HTML
> wrapper around the v0.4.2 JSON API) ship in **v0.4.4**, and the
> tenant-scoped admin surface (where tenant admins administer their
> own tenant rather than the cesauth operator administering every
> tenant) is **0.4.5+**.

---

## The four boundaries

cesauth's tenancy service model layers four orthogonal concerns on
top of `users` / `sessions`:

1. **Tenancy** (`crate::tenancy`) — *who is in what?* Tenants,
   organizations, groups. Every tenant-scoped row carries a
   `tenant_id` that anchors it; cross-tenant data leakage is
   prevented at the data layer rather than relying on application
   code to remember to filter.

2. **Account type** (`tenancy::AccountType`) — *what kind of
   principal is this?* `HumanUser`, `ServiceAccount`,
   `SystemOperator`, `Anonymous`, `ExternalFederatedUser`.
   Deliberately separate from authorization. A `SystemOperator`
   account is *not* automatically privileged; capabilities come
   only from role assignments.

3. **Authorization** (`crate::authz`) — *what can they do, and
   where?* Permissions, roles, scoped role assignments. There is
   exactly one entry point, `check_permission`, that callers must
   use. Spec §9.2 ("権限判定関数を単一のモジュールに集約する")
   is enforced by convention and by the absence of any other
   permission-checking surface in the crate.

4. **Billing** (`crate::billing`) — *what does the tenant pay for?*
   Plans, subscriptions, subscription history. Plans and
   subscriptions are strictly separated (§8.6); a plan upgrade is a
   single subscription update, not a re-stamp of tenant data.

Memberships connect (1) and the rest. A user belongs to a tenant
through `user_tenant_memberships`; to organizations through
`user_organization_memberships`; to groups through
`user_group_memberships`. Memberships are **relations, not
attributes** (spec §2 principle 4): nothing on the `users` row says
"I'm in tenant X". Multiple memberships per user are first-class.

---

## Tenancy

A `Tenant` is the outermost boundary. Every tenant carries a slug
(URL-safe key, immutable in practice) and a status:

- `pending` — created but not yet activated (placeholder for the
  invitation / billing-completion flows that arrive with self-signup).
- `active` — normal operation.
- `suspended` — operator action; data retained, sign-in blocked.
- `deleted` — soft-deleted; a future retention job purges.

A new deployment migrates with one bootstrap tenant whose id is the
constant `tenancy::DEFAULT_TENANT_ID` (`"tenant-default"`). Existing
v0.3.x rows in `users`, `sessions`, etc. are not yet associated to
this tenant — the backfill that adds a `tenant_id` column to those
tables is part of 0.4.1's schema work.

### Organizations

A tenant's interior structure. Departments, customer sub-accounts,
operational teams. Org slugs are unique per tenant (the `unique
(tenant_id, slug)` index in 0003_tenancy.sql).

The `parent_organization_id` column exists for future hierarchy.
v0.4.0's service layer ignores it; trees of orgs are not modeled.

### Groups

A logical unit usable for both membership ("these people belong
together") and authorization ("grant this role to these people at
once"). Spec §3.3 cautions that the use-case must be clear; the
data model does not enforce a distinction, so operator discipline is
required.

A group's parent is encoded by [`GroupParent`]:

```rust
pub enum GroupParent {
    Tenant,
    Organization { organization_id: Id },
}
```

Tenant-scoped groups (`GroupParent::Tenant`) live directly under a
tenant — useful for "all-staff" or "billing-admins" groups that
cross every org. Org-scoped groups live under one organization —
"engineering-oncall", "ops-team". The CHECK in 0003_tenancy.sql
enforces that `parent_kind = 'tenant'` rows have NULL
`organization_id`, and the converse.

---

## Account types

Five values, none of which imply administrative capability:

| `AccountType`             | Used for                                                        |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `human_user`              | Ordinary end-user, password / passkey, self-registered.          |
| `service_account`         | Machine principal for API integrations. Bearer / mTLS.            |
| `system_operator`         | cesauth's own operators (separate from a tenant's admins).        |
| `anonymous`               | Bounded trial principal. Promotion flow is a 0.4.6 follow-up.     |
| `external_federated_user` | Identity in an external IdP, role assignments local to cesauth. Federation wiring is a follow-up. |

Spec §5 is explicit: "user_type のみで admin 判定を行わない".
Even `system_operator` requires a `system_admin` role assignment to
do anything privileged. The data model and the authz engine refuse
to mix the two concepts.

---

## Authorization

### Permissions

A `Permission` is a string like `"tenant:update"` or
`"organization:member:add"`. The `permissions` table in
0003_tenancy.sql ships seeded with 25 entries; operators may add
their own rows for custom workflows.

The constants in `cesauth_core::authz::PermissionCatalog` mirror the
shipped set. Application code referencing a permission should always
go through one of those constants — the migration is what guarantees
the row exists.

### Roles

A role is a named bundle of permissions. Two flavors:

- **System roles** (`tenant_id IS NULL`) — visible from every
  tenant. The six built-ins are seeded by 0003_tenancy.sql:
  `system_admin`, `system_readonly`, `tenant_admin`,
  `tenant_readonly`, `organization_admin`, `organization_member`.
- **Tenant-local roles** (`tenant_id = T`) — defined by a tenant
  for itself, invisible to other tenants. The CRUD surface for
  these arrives with 0.4.1's routes.

### Role assignments

A row in `role_assignments` says: "user U has role R within scope S,
granted by G at time T, optionally expiring at X". The `Scope` enum
is the heart of the model:

```rust
pub enum Scope {
    System,
    Tenant       { tenant_id:       Id },
    Organization { organization_id: Id },
    Group        { group_id:        Id },
    User         { user_id:         Id },
}
```

A `System` scope is for cesauth's own operator staff; only system
operators ever get one. The other four scope flavors are the natural
addressing of the tenancy tree.

### `check_permission` — the one entry point

Every authorization check funnels through:

```rust
async fn check_permission<RA, RR>(
    assignments: &RA,
    roles:       &RR,
    user_id:    &str,
    permission: &str,
    scope:      ScopeRef<'_>,
    now_unix:   i64,
) -> PortResult<CheckOutcome>;
```

The function is pure over its port reads — it never writes audit
events, never has side effects. Callers decide what to log around
the check.

The result is `CheckOutcome::Allowed { role_id, scope }` (carries
which assignment granted it, for the caller's audit) or
`CheckOutcome::Denied(DenyReason)`. The deny reasons are
distinguishable on purpose:

| `DenyReason`        | Meaning                                                   |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `NoAssignments`     | User has no role assignments at all.                      |
| `ScopeMismatch`     | Has assignments, none cover the queried scope.            |
| `PermissionMissing` | Covers the scope, but no role grants the permission.      |
| `Expired`           | A would-have-been-allowed assignment has expired.         |

Surfacing `Expired` separately makes "access broke because the grant
expired" patterns visible in the audit log.

### Scope-covering lattice

A `System` grant covers every scope. Otherwise, in v0.4.0, a grant
covers only the **same-id** scope (a `Tenant{T}` grant covers a
query at `Tenant{T}`, not at `Organization{O in T}`).

Cross-tier coverage — "my tenant grant should apply to every org
inside" — is implemented by **the caller**, not by
`check_permission`: the caller knows which tenant the operation
naturally lives in and queries at that scope. The decision to keep
`check_permission` lattice-direct rather than full-tree-walking is
deliberate:

- The function stays pure and cheap (one port read, plus role lookups).
- The route handler always knows the operation's natural scope (the
  operation operates on a specific tenant / org / group / user); it
  passes that as the `ScopeRef` and the lattice does the rest.
- Adding cross-tier coverage later, if needed, is a layered helper
  (`check_permission_with_tree(..., tree_reader)`) — additive, not a
  semantics change.

---

## Billing

`Plan` and `Subscription` are strictly separated. The four built-in
plans seeded by 0003_tenancy.sql are `free`, `trial`, `pro`,
`enterprise`. Each carries:

- `features` — list of `FeatureFlag` strings (e.g. `pro_features`).
  Stable string keys so a feature flag can be added without a Rust
  release.
- `quotas` — list of `Quota { name, value }` pairs. Value `-1`
  means unlimited; positive values are hard caps. Names are stable
  keys: `max_users`, `max_organizations`, `max_groups`.
- `price_description` — display hint for the admin UI. cesauth does
  NOT compute invoices.

A `Subscription` is the one-active-row-per-tenant relationship:

- `lifecycle` (`trial` / `paid` / `grace`) and `status` (`active` /
  `past_due` / `cancelled` / `expired`) are **orthogonal**: a trial
  can be Active or Cancelled; a paid subscription can be Active or
  PastDue. Spec §8.6 ("試用状態と本契約状態を分ける") is the
  reason.
- `current_period_end` and `trial_ends_at` are nullable wall-clock
  reference points; cesauth schedules nothing yet (no cron is wired
  up in 0.4.0).

`SubscriptionHistoryEntry` is append-only. One row per state change
gives the audit answer to "when did this tenant move plans?" without
relying on log archaeology.

> **Quota enforcement is deferred.** The plan carries the numbers;
> the runtime checks at user-create / org-create / group-create
> arrive with 0.4.1 alongside the route layer.

## What ships in v0.4.x and what does not

### Ships in 0.4.0

- All entity types (`Tenant`, `Organization`, `Group`, `User`-via-existing,
  `Permission`, `Role`, `RoleAssignment`, `Plan`, `Subscription`,
  `SubscriptionHistoryEntry`).
- All membership types and the unified `MembershipRepository` port.
- The full `check_permission` engine.
- In-memory adapters for every new port (host-test layer).
- D1 schema in `migrations/0003_tenancy.sql` — seeded with one
  bootstrap tenant, six system roles, four built-in plans, and 25
  catalog permissions.

### Added in 0.4.1

- **Cloudflare D1 adapters** for all ten new ports
  (`tenancy::Cloudflare{Tenant,Organization,Group,Membership}Repository`,
  `authz::Cloudflare{Permission,Role,RoleAssignment}Repository`,
  `billing::Cloudflare{Plan,Subscription,SubscriptionHistory}Repository`).
- **`User` table tenant-aware** via
  `migrations/0004_user_tenancy_backfill.sql`. Every pre-0.4.1 user
  is migrated into the `tenant-default` bootstrap tenant. Email
  uniqueness becomes per-tenant: two tenants may both have an
  `alice@example.com`. The `User` struct gains
  `tenant_id` + `account_type` (with `serde(default)` for
  forward/back compat with cached payloads).
- **Auto-membership backfill**: every existing user gets a
  `user_tenant_memberships` row in the bootstrap tenant with role
  `member`, so post-migration there are zero tenant-less users.

### Added in 0.4.2

- **`/api/v1/...` HTTP API** for the tenancy data model.
  Tenants, organizations, groups, three flavors of membership,
  role assignments, subscriptions — full CRUD for each, JSON-only,
  gated through the existing admin-bearer mechanism. See the
  CHANGELOG `[0.4.2]` entry for the route catalogue.
- **Two new admin capabilities**: `ViewTenancy` (every valid role)
  and `ManageTenancy` (Operations+ — same tier as `EditBucketSafety`
  / `EditThreshold` / `CreateUser`).
- **Plan-quota enforcement** at organization-create and group-create.
  The pure decision logic is `cesauth_core::billing::quota_decision`;
  the worker reads the current count via `SELECT COUNT(*)` and feeds
  it in. A `quota_exceeded:max_organizations` (or `max_groups`) 409
  surfaces to the caller. `max_users` enforcement waits for the
  user-create surface to land in 0.4.3+ (today users are created
  by the legacy admin route which bypasses quota).
- **14 new audit `EventKind` variants** for tenancy mutations —
  `TenantCreated` through `SubscriptionStatusChanged`. Every
  mutating route emits one with actor (admin token id), subject
  (created/affected row id), and a structured `reason` field.

### Added in 0.4.3

- **Read-only HTML SaaS console** at `/admin/saas/*`, parallel to
  (and visually distinct from) the v0.3.x cost / data-safety
  console at `/admin/console/*`. Five pages:
  - `/admin/saas` — overview with deployment-wide counters and a
    per-plan subscriber breakdown.
  - `/admin/saas/tenants` — list of every non-deleted tenant.
  - `/admin/saas/tenants/:tid` — single tenant view (summary,
    subscription with plan label, organization list, member list).
  - `/admin/saas/organizations/:oid` — single organization view
    (groups, members).
  - `/admin/saas/tenants/:tid/subscription/history` — append-only
    change log, reverse-chronological.
  - `/admin/saas/users/:uid/role_assignments` — every assignment
    held by one user, across every scope, with rendered scope
    drill-links.
- **Distinct nav frame** (`SaasTab`) with two top-level tabs
  (Overview, Tenants); the User-roles tab is a drill-in
  destination only and is filtered out of the nav even when
  active. Footer carries a `read-only` marker.
- The console is read-only **by design**. Mutations continue to
  flow through the v0.4.2 JSON API. The HTML preview/confirm
  forms (the v0.3.1-style two-step pattern, applied to tenancy
  mutations) ship in v0.4.4. The split mirrors the 0.3.0 → 0.3.1
  split and lets the read pages settle before the write surface
  arrives.

### Does NOT ship in v0.4.x (yet)

The CHANGELOG `Deferred` sections and `ROADMAP.md` track each item.
Headlines:

- **HTML mutation forms** wrapping the v0.4.2 API. Two-step
  preview/confirm pattern from v0.3.1, applied to tenant create /
  update / status, organization create / status, group create /
  delete, membership add / remove, role grant / revoke, and
  subscription plan/status changes. **0.4.4.**
- **Tenant-scoped admin surface**. The v0.4.3 console serves the
  cesauth deployment's operator staff — one console, every tenant.
  A tenant-scoped surface (where tenant admins administer their
  own tenant rather than every tenant) is a parallel UI reachable
  from a tenant-side login, gated through user-as-bearer plus
  `check_permission`. **0.4.5+.**
- **`check_permission` integration on the API surface.** v0.4.2
  routes go through `ensure_role_allows` (admin-side capability)
  rather than `check_permission` because admin tokens have no row
  in `users` to feed into the spec-§9.1 scope-walk. The two
  converge once user-as-bearer arrives.
- **Anonymous-trial promotion.** The account type exists; the
  promotion lifecycle is unspecified. **0.4.6.**
- **External IdP federation.** `AccountType::ExternalFederatedUser`
  is reserved; no IdP wiring exists yet.

## Operator runbook (v0.4.x)

### Running the migrations

A 0.3.x → 0.4.1 upgrade runs two migrations:

```bash
# 0003 — adds tenancy / authz / billing schema. Idempotent
# (INSERT OR IGNORE throughout); safe to re-run.
wrangler d1 execute cesauth --remote --file migrations/0003_tenancy.sql

# 0004 — adds tenant_id + account_type to the users table and
# backfills every existing row into the bootstrap tenant. Uses
# SQLite "rename, recreate, copy"; not safe to run against a live
# writer (same caveat as the 0001 baseline).
wrangler d1 execute cesauth --remote --file migrations/0004_user_tenancy_backfill.sql
```

After 0004, every user has `tenant_id = 'tenant-default'`,
`account_type = 'human_user'`, and a matching row in
`user_tenant_memberships` with role `member`. Re-grade owners /
admins / service-accounts out-of-band — the migration cannot infer
those from pre-0.4 data.

### Inspecting the seeded catalog

```bash
# Permissions catalog
wrangler d1 execute cesauth --remote \
  --command "SELECT name FROM permissions ORDER BY name"

# System roles
wrangler d1 execute cesauth --remote \
  --command "SELECT slug, display_name FROM roles WHERE tenant_id IS NULL"

# Built-in plans
wrangler d1 execute cesauth --remote \
  --command "SELECT slug, display_name, active FROM plans"
```

### Promoting an operator to system_admin

The HTML form for granting roles lands with v0.4.4's mutation
console; in the meantime — and for emergency recoveries — use
wrangler:

```bash
# Replace USER_ID with an existing row from `users`.
wrangler d1 execute cesauth --remote --command "
  INSERT INTO role_assignments (id, user_id, role_id, scope_type, scope_id,
                                granted_by, granted_at)
  VALUES (lower(hex(randomblob(16))),
          'USER_ID',
          'role-system-admin',
          'system', NULL,
          'wrangler-bootstrap',
          strftime('%s','now'));
"
```

After this, calling code that goes through `check_permission`
with `ScopeRef::System` (or any narrower scope) will see this user
as Allowed.

### Re-grading an account type

`account_type` is updatable through the standard
`UserRepository::update` path (the v0.4.1 D1 adapter writes the
column). To convert an end-user row into a service account
out-of-band:

```bash
wrangler d1 execute cesauth --remote --command "
  UPDATE users SET account_type = 'service_account', updated_at = strftime('%s','now')
  WHERE id = 'USER_ID';
"
```

`tenant_id` is NOT updatable via the repository; moving a user
between tenants is destructive (it orphans every membership and
role assignment) and requires its own dedicated path. None ships
in 0.4.x.

### What about existing users?

Pre-0.4.1, the `users` table had no tenancy concept. Migration
0004 retroactively places every user in `tenant-default` (the
bootstrap tenant seeded by 0003) with `account_type = 'human_user'`,
and inserts a matching `user_tenant_memberships` row.
For single-tenant deployments this is the entire story — keep
running, no operator action required.

### Inspecting tenancy state in the browser (v0.4.3+)

The SaaS console at `/admin/saas/*` is the read-only HTML view of
the same data the API surface exposes. Use the same admin bearer
as the API:

```bash
# Browser: paste this URL after loading any /admin/console/* page
# (which establishes the admin bearer in the browser session via
# the existing session-cookie path), or curl with the bearer header.

curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_API_KEY" \
     https://cesauth.example/admin/saas
```

Pages:

| URL                                                           | Shows                                                                     |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/admin/saas`                                                 | Counters + per-plan subscriber breakdown                                  |
| `/admin/saas/tenants`                                         | Every non-deleted tenant                                                  |
| `/admin/saas/tenants/{id}`                                    | One tenant: summary, subscription, organizations, members                 |
| `/admin/saas/tenants/{id}/subscription/history`               | Append-only change log for that tenant's subscription                     |
| `/admin/saas/organizations/{id}`                              | One organization: groups, members                                         |
| `/admin/saas/users/{id}/role_assignments`                     | Every role assignment held by one user, across every scope                |

Every page is gated through `AdminAction::ViewTenancy`, which is
open to **all four roles** (ReadOnly, Security, Operations, Super).
Mutating the underlying state still requires `ManageTenancy`
(Operations+), and the only way to trigger that capability today
is via the v0.4.2 JSON API or a wrangler shell. The HTML mutation
console is v0.4.4.

### API smoke-test (v0.4.2+)

The `/api/v1/...` surface is gated through the same admin-bearer
mechanism as the `/admin/console/...` routes. A fresh deployment
can use the `ADMIN_API_KEY` bootstrap secret directly; once a
named Super token exists, prefer that for traceable audit lines.

```bash
ADMIN=$ADMIN_API_KEY  # or a minted Super token

# 1. Provision a tenant + owner. The owner must already exist in
#    `users`; this API does not auto-create users.
curl -sS -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"slug":"acme","display_name":"Acme Corp","owner_user_id":"USER_ID"}' \
     https://cesauth.example/api/v1/tenants

# 2. Create an organization in that tenant.
curl -sS -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"slug":"engineering","display_name":"Engineering"}' \
     https://cesauth.example/api/v1/tenants/TENANT_ID/organizations

# 3. Create a tenant-scoped group.
curl -sS -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"parent_kind":"tenant","slug":"all-staff","display_name":"All Staff"}' \
     https://cesauth.example/api/v1/tenants/TENANT_ID/groups

# 4. Grant the owner the system tenant_admin role within their tenant.
curl -sS -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "user_id": "USER_ID",
           "role_id": "role-tenant-admin",
           "scope":   { "scope": "tenant", "tenant_id": "TENANT_ID" }
         }' \
     https://cesauth.example/api/v1/role_assignments

# 5. Move the tenant onto the Pro plan (subscription must already exist).
curl -sS -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"plan_id":"plan-pro"}' \
     https://cesauth.example/api/v1/tenants/TENANT_ID/subscription/plan
```

Plan-quota enforcement (`max_organizations`, `max_groups`) returns
`409 Conflict` with body `{"error":"quota_exceeded:max_organizations"}`
when the next create would exceed the plan's limit. Free-plan
defaults are 1 organization and 10 groups; see the seeded `plans`
table in `0003_tenancy.sql`.
